## Python mentoring

Today I prepared the first class of Python for my brother Juan, the idea was to have a quick talk to set the expectations around what he wants to do with Python, the first idea for him was to create a plant simulator (not a game, just to simulate how a plant works), so we started by setting variables, classes and inheritance, also to check the difference between strong typed and dynamically typed languages and OOP vs Functional programming.

We did some exercises using [hackerrank.com](https://hackerrank.com) and [codewars.com](https://codewars.com), since was an introductory class we did the most entry-level problems using **Ruby** and **Python** to learn about the syntax difference:

### Jaden Casing Strings

On Ruby:

{% highlight ruby linenos %}
class String
  def to_jaden_case
    self.split.map(&:capitalize).join(" ")
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}

On Python

{% highlight python linenos %}
import string

def to_jaden_case(sentence):
  return string.capwords(sentence)
{% endhighlight %}

## Github Sponsors

Also today I applied for the [Github Sponsors Programm](https://github.com/sponsors), hopefully I will get the approval to see how this works and if is possible for a latin-american to have the same oportunities in this aspect.

The github sponsors seems to be a very good idea to support the Open-source development, I know I'm not the best collaborator on Github but to knock the door is not to go inside.
