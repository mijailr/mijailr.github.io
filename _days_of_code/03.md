## Learning about Rust

Today I watched some articles related with [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and seems to be very interesting, probably I will try to make something with this language, but for now I will keep this on my list of `cool things to learn`.

If you have the time to watch some videos related with Rust, you should check the channel [YouCodeThings](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0yCXVwW6FdDQGYA-3OWXxw) on YouTube, this channel have some interesting videos using Rust and is very well explained and funny.
