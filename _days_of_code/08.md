Today I did an Alfred Workflow for getting the top 10 articles from [dev.to](https://dev.to).

{% include images.html

            title="Alfred top 10 dev.to"
            %}

I use [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) with many workflows every day, is a very good tool for boost your productivity if you make the initial effort to be used to the change.

Another thing that I like to do is to read the top articles on [dev.to](https://dev.to) but I didn't found any Alfred workflow for dev.to, so this was a great opportunity to build something useful (at last for me) and as part of my [#100DaysOfCode](https://mijailr.com/days_of_code/) challenge I decided to create a workflow for dev.to.

There is an Open API to get some information from dev.to, so using a simple query you can get the top 10 articles for the day:

```bash
curl https://dev.to/api/articles?top=1&per_page=10 | jq
```

My first thought was to use a bash script to get the articles and parse everything with `jq` but since `jq` doesn't come pre-installed on MacOS, so searching on the web about the best way to create an Alfred Workflow, wasn't hard to find an excellent library called [alfred-workflow](https://github.com/deanishe/alfred-workflow), created an maintained by Dean Jackson (@deanishe), so cheers to him because he made the harder part.

This library was written on Python so the answer to the question _How we can make a high quality Alfred workflow?_ is with Python and `alfred-workflow`. Also the documentation is very good so is easy to start.
