Useful commands
---------------

### Cron-job

Cron-job is a tool for triggering application based on a schedule, when you need to run an specific task on a time basis logic you can use cron-tab, currently there are a ton of tools for running programmed tasks but in scense all have the same behaviour and configuration as cron-tab.

You can recognize the same configuration configuration files for kubernetes, aws, etc.

{% highlight bash linenos %}
# AWS example
aws events put-rule --schedule-expression "cron(*/5 * * * *)" --name MyRule1
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight yml linenos %}
# Kubernetes example
apiVersion: batch/v1beta1
kind: CronJob
metadata:
  name: hello
spec:
  schedule: "*/5 * * * *"
  jobTemplate:
    spec:
      template:
        spec:
          containers:
          - name: hello
            image: busybox
            args:
            - /bin/sh
            - -c
            - date; echo Hello from the Kubernetes cluster
          restartPolicy: OnFailure
{% endhighlight %}

#### How to write a cron job

To create a cron job you need to run `crontab -e`, it will create a cron job for the current user.

```
# ┌───────────── minute (0 - 59)
# │ ┌───────────── hour (0 - 23)
# │ │ ┌───────────── day of the month (1 - 31)
# │ │ │ ┌───────────── month (1 - 12)
# │ │ │ │ ┌───────────── day of the week (0 - 6) (Sunday to Saturday)
# │ │ │ │ │
# │ │ │ │ │
# │ │ │ │ │
# * * * * * <command to execute>
```

You can also use reserved words to execute commands:

| Entry                       | Description                                                | Equivalent to |
|:----------------------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------|:--------------|
| `@yearly` (or `@annually`\) | Run once a year at midnight of 1 January                   | 0 0 1 1 \*    |
| `@monthly`                  | Run once a month at midnight of the first day of the month | 0 0 1 * \*    |
| `@weekly`                   | Run once a week at midnight on Sunday morning              | 0 0 * * 0     |
| `@daily` (or `@midnight`\)  | Run once a day at midnight                                 | 0 0 * * \*    |
| `@hourly`                   | Run once an hour at the beginning of the hour              | 0 * * * \*    |
| `@reboot`                   | Run at startup                                             | N/A           |
{: .table }

Examples
--------

{% highlight bash linenos %}
0 * * * * bash /home/gabriela/run.sh
*/5 * * * * bash /home/gabriela/run.sh
* */2 * * * bash /home/gabriela/run.sh
{% endhighlight %}

Exit codes
----------

Each script or program that is executed on a bash always (with certain exceptions) put a exit code to know if the program execution was successful or not.

-	Exit code `0` = Success
-	Exit code from `1` to `255` Failure

Some programs add specific exit codes depending on the failure type. But for convention we use:

-	`1` - Catchall for general errors
-	`2` - Misuse of shell builtins (according to Bash documentation)
-	`126` - Command invoked cannot execute
-	`127` - “command not found”
-	`128` - Invalid argument to exit
-	`128+n` - Fatal error signal “n”
-	`130` - Script terminated by Control-C
-	`255\*` - Exit status out of range

You can use `echo $?` to know the last command exit code.

This is useful to know since on the pipeline when you have complex tasks you can return an specific exit code for handling exceptions.

{% highlight bash linenos %}
#!/bin/bash

cat file.txt

if [ $? -eq 0 ]
then
  echo "The script ran ok"
  exit 0
else
  echo "The script failed" >&2
  exit 1
fi
{% endhighlight %}

Excercise time
--------------

Create a bash script to write to a file called `status.txt` and a cron job to run that script every 2 minutes:

-	`Success` when the file.txt exists.
-	`Error` when the file.txt doesn't exists.
